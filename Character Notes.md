## Glossary

### Dodge

### [Dodge Staling](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Dodge_staling)

Every time a player uses a [Dodge](#dodge) they get a level of Dodge Staleness, up to a max of 5.

Each level of Dodge Staleness reduces the speed, distance, and [Intangibility](#intangibility) frames of a player's Dodges.

Dodge Staleness dissapates at a rate of 1 level / 2 seconds.

There is also 1 second timer that starts when you Dodge, and on expiration you lose a level of Dodge Staleness. Simply put, Dodges will always be fresh if you use them no more than once a second.

### Intangibility

### Invincibility

### Knockback

### Super Armor

Certain attacks in SSBU grant full or partial immunity to [Knockback](#knockback) while performing them, this is called Super Armor.

There are three variants of Super Armor present in the game:

- Infinite: Super Armor that is not removed by any amount of damage or knockback
- Damage-based: Super Armor that is removed by receiving a certain amount of damage
- Knockback-based: Super Armor that is removed by receiving a certain amount of knockback

Super Armor is often confused with [Invincibility](#invincibility), which is incorrect. Most attacks with Super Armor do not reduce the damage you receive while performing them.

### Tanking

To intentionally be hit or damaged by an attack.

The terms 'tank' and 'tanking' come from RPGs and refer to a heavily armored character, much like an actual military tank, that is responsible for being the primary target of a boss and/or monsters.

In SSBU, attacks that are uninterruptible and/or grant [Super Armor](#super-armor) allow you to tank the damage of an opponent's attack while still landing your attack.

### Gap Closing

The most basic definition of Gap Closing would be "to shorten the distance between yourself and an opponent".

More technically, Gap Closing is when you bypass/avoid/[tank](#tanking) an opponent's mid-range and long-range attacks to get in range of your close-range attacks.

## 1. Mario

### [ZeRo Video Guide Notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yOEODd8y2Q)

Mario previously leaned heavily on his roll because of his short range, [Dodge Staling](#dodge-staling) makes this difficult in SSBU.

Because of this, the hardest part of Mario is [Gap Closing](#gap-closing).

### [Crouch Dash Tactics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDugp8gLiu0&t=2s)

Can cancel crouch dash with up and back to feint, returns to standing

Most tilts are instantly cancellable out of a normal dash -> Good for whiff punishing

Crouch dash into dash grab is a good fakeout

In close range, mixup between jab / uptilt / empty shorthop / fadeback fair / jump fastfall fair

Against shield, fair into egwf, if they let go of shield to counter they get immediately punished

Against shield, can also go for tomahawk into hell's gate
